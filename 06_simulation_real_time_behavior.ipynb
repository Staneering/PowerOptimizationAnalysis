    "### **Explanation of the Notebook**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Simulating Load Surge**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   * We simulate a **random surge in active power** (representing increased demand, such as from **EV charging**).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Simulating Renewable Energy Variability**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   * The **voltage** is adjusted based on the increase in **active power** (simulating **renewable energy variability** or grid instability).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Simulating Voltage Spikes (Faults)**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   * **Voltage spikes** are introduced randomly to simulate faults in the grid (e.g., sudden voltage surges).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Q-learning Decision**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   * The **Q-learning model** reacts to these changes in real-time by adjusting **load distribution** across **sub-metering** based on the **current state** (voltage and load).\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Tracking and Visualizing Performance**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   * We track **voltage** and **load** over time and visualize the impact of **load surges** and **voltage fluctuations** on the grid.\n",
    "   * The corresponding **actions taken by the Q-learning model** are printed and visualized.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Next Steps**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Run the notebook** to simulate **real-time grid behavior** and test the performance of the **Q-learning model** under dynamic conditions.\n",
    "2. **Observe** how the model reacts to **load surges**, **voltage fluctuations**, and **voltage spikes** (faults).\n",
    "3. If needed, **fine-tune** the **reward function**, **exploration rate**, or **other model parameters** to improve performance.\n",
